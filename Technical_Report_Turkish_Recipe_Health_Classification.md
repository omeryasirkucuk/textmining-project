## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

The increasing awareness of nutrition and health has created a significant demand for automated dietary assessment tools. Traditional manual classification of recipes based on health criteria is time-consuming and subjective. With the proliferation of digital recipe platforms, there exists an opportunity to leverage text mining and machine learning techniques to automate this process.

Turkish cuisine, with its rich diversity and complex ingredient combinations, presents unique challenges for automated health classification. The linguistic characteristics of Turkish, combined with cultural cooking practices, require specialized approaches in natural language processing and feature extraction.

### 1.2 Research Objectives

This research aims to:
- Develop an automated system for classifying Turkish recipes into health categories
- Implement advanced text mining techniques for Turkish culinary text processing
- Create a comprehensive feature engineering pipeline combining textual and numerical data
- Evaluate multiple machine learning approaches for optimal classification performance
- Provide insights into the relationship between recipe characteristics and health classifications

### 1.3 Contribution

Our work contributes to the field by:
- Introducing the first large-scale Turkish recipe health classification dataset
- Developing domain-specific text mining techniques for Turkish culinary content
- Demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal feature engineering in recipe analysis
- Providing a production-ready system with interactive visualization capabilities

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Text Mining in Culinary Domain

Previous research in culinary text mining has primarily focused on English-language datasets and basic ingredient extraction. Studies by Chen et al. (2019) and Rodriguez et al. (2020) demonstrated the potential of NLP techniques in recipe analysis, but lacked comprehensive health classification frameworks.

### 2.2 Health Classification Methodologies

Traditional approaches to recipe health assessment have relied on simple caloric calculations or basic ingredient categorization. Recent advances in machine learning have enabled more sophisticated approaches, incorporating multiple nutritional factors and cooking methods.

### 2.3 Turkish Language Processing

Turkish, as an agglutinative language, presents unique challenges for text processing. The morphological complexity requires specialized tokenization and normalization techniques, which have been addressed in limited culinary contexts.
